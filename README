 This is the Qbox package.

 Qbox is a C++/MPI/OpenMP implementation of First-Principles Molecular Dynamics.
 It implements electronic structure calculations within the framework
 of Density Functional Theory, using a plane-wave basis set and
 norm-conserving pseudopotentials.

 Qbox is developed in the Gygi group at the Department of Computer
 Science of the University of California Davis. It is available under the
 GNU Public License.

 Qbox was written by Francois Gygi. 
 Ivan Duchemin developed the Hartree-Fock exchange implementation and the 
 client-server interface. 
 Jun Wu developed the implementation of van der Waals density functionals.
 Quan (Andy) Wan implemented the FFTW3 interface
 William Dawson contributed to the implementation of Hartree-Fock exchange
 Martin Schlipf implemented Optimized Norm-Conserving Vanderbilt potentials
 Quan (Andy) Wan implemented the electric field
