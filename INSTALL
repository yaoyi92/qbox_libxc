 Qbox installation requires the following libraries:

 - BLAS (or ATLAS) 	http://www.netlib.org/atlas
			http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net
 - LAPACK 		http://www.netlib.org/lapack
 - BLACS		http://www.netlib.org/scalapack
 - ScaLAPACK 		http://www.netlib.org/scalapack
 - FFTW 2.1.5 		http://www.fftw.org
 - Apache Xerces-C	http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c

 Once these libraries are installed, a Makefile header must be created to
 include the proper locations of libraries. The best way to create a 
 Makefile header is to start from one of the examples provided in the build
 directory, and modify it for the desired target platform. The
 makefile header must be placed in the src directory. To build Qbox, the
 following commands can then be used (assuming the Makefile header is
 "myplatform.mk"):

 $ export TARGET=myplatform
 $ make

 Notes:
 - On some platforms (notably AIX) gmake must be used instead of make.
 - On some platforms, the blas and lapack libraries provided in the 
   /usr/lib64 directory are not reliable and cause Qbox to produce NaNs.
   Rebuilding the ATLAS and LAPACK libraries from the netlib distribution
   solves this problem.
 - The autoconf/automake process is not used since it is difficult to make
   it work for cross-compilation (e.g. on BG/L).
 - The Xerces-C library can be 2.8.0 or 3.x.y. 
 - On CentOS-6 and CentOS-7 platforms, all libraries can be installed using yum.
